// NOTE: This is in a separate file because our build depends on it and
// we want to minimize the transitive dependencies of the build binary
// itself.

/// Supported locales for the application. This must be kept up to date
/// with the translations available in the `po/` directory; this is used
/// by our build process as well runtime libghostty APIs.
///
/// The order also matters. For incomplete locale information (i.e. only
/// a language code available), the first match is used. For example, if
/// we know the user requested `zh` but has no script code, then we'd pick
/// the first locale that matches `zh`.
///
/// For ordering, we prefer:
///
///   1. The most common locales first, since there are places in the code
///      where we do linear searches for a locale and we want to minimize
///      the number of iterations for the common case.
///
///   2. Alphabetical for otherwise equally common locales.
///
///   3. Most preferred locale for a language without a country code.
///
/// Note for "most common" locales, this is subjective and based on
/// the perceived userbase of Ghostty, which may not be representative
/// of general populations or global language distribution. Also note
/// that ordering may be weird when we first merge a new locale since
/// we don't have a good way to determine this. We can always reorder
/// with some data.
